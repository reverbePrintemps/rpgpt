              ðŸ“£ Due to a sudden and unexpected increase in popularity for this
              app, I have had to revoke the API key as I cannot currently incur
              the costs. Instead you will find a "buy me a tea" button where you
              can donate in any way you can. Hopefully, with a bit of help we'll
              be able to bring the adventure back online very soon. Apologies
              for the inconvenience! ðŸ“£
