# TODO

## Ongoing

- [ ] Implement save payment details and pay later (https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-and-reuse?platform=web&ui=checkout)

## Backlog

### Features

- [ ] Bottom tabs for navigation on mobile
- [ ] What if no local storage? Use cookies? Or force login?
- [ ] Improve content/styling of home page
- [ ] Improve styling of /account page
- [ ] Improve app metadata (favicon, manifest, social sharing cards, etc.)
- [ ] Add tests for usage calculation (incl. local storage)
- [ ] Handle case when max_tokens are exceeded
- [ ] More comprehensive firebase error messages. Currently we're just passing the error message, such as: "Firebase: Error (auth/user-not-found)."
- [ ] Add delimiter around property names in system message to see if it helps the model understand instructions better
- [ ] Improve model persona in system message (Rocco was told he couldn't rob a bank. This shows model isn't fully aware that they are a game master)
- [ ] Sometimes, the openai API responds with simple text before proceeding with the requested JSON. Handle this case.

### Bugs

- [ ] Fix theme switching
- [ ] Theme picker should always show currently selected theme. (although this sounds like an easy bug it probably isn't as it involves rethinking how we set/get the theme)
  - Currently we only set the theme locally using localStorage. We might want to use cookies instead. Also, theming might even be irrelevant since the game programmatically changes the theme.
- [ ] Firefox mobile seems to zoom in on input focus (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69495070/prevent-zooming-in-after-input-field-focus-in-firefox-on-mobile)
- [ ] Disable choice buttons when loading.
- [ ] When loading, the previous (or current) round's input shows a spinner after submission.
- [ ] Model doesn't seem to reliably understand that options and prompt examples need to be different.

### Tech debt

- [ ] Remove all usage of "prose" classNames and uninstall @tailwindcss/typography (doesn't actually make things easy when themes are involved)
- [ ] Unify local/db token usage logic
- [ ] Fix issue with window (or localStorage) not being available even though components are marked as "use client"
- [ ] Create a constant for all routes in the app and use them instead of hardcoding strings
- [ ] Improve accessibility of top level Menu (currently no focus nor focus state)
- [ ] Fetch account info server side when loading /account
- [ ] Refactor the logic to update token usage. Currently we get last 2 messages on a response. Better would be to update usage on a per-message basis.
- [ ] Refactor/improve Round component by extracting components, state and logic where relevant.
